# Gesture-Based Volume Control System

## Project Overview
This project allows users to control their system audio using **hand gestures**. By leveraging **computer vision** and **hand tracking**, users can:
- Adjust system volume dynamically using the thumb and index finger.
- Mute/unmute the system by showing a fist or an open palm.
- Receive real-time visual feedback via a volume bar and status display.

This provides a **touchless and accessible solution** for users, including those with physical disabilities.

## Problem Statement
Many people with limited mobility or physical disabilities face difficulties using traditional input devices to control audio. This project provides an **assistive, intuitive, and contactless interface** to adjust volume and mute/unmute, promoting accessibility and inclusivity.
